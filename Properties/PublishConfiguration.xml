# Performance Tweaks (Beta)

This Cities Skylines 2 mod contains various tweaks that increase performance.

## GPU-based Adjustements

- **LOD Adjustments**: decrease the lod min distances on many objects in the game. These objects are chosed because they either have LOD thresholds that are too high OR the game did not include additional LOD meshes.
- **Shadow Patches**: the game currently doesn't use some of your Settings > Graphics > Shadow config when rendering shadow resolutions. This patches that and also allows you to increase shadow performance beyond the allowed settings.
- **Terrain Culling**: a system that removes objects from the rendering pipeline if they are obstructed by terrain. Enabling this increases CPU usage.
